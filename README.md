# Machine Learning Algorithms
The repository is a personal project of implementing all of the machine learning algorithms that I learnt from scratch. I do so as to get a better intuitive understanding of the different algorithms, how they work, their complexity and their limits.

So far, the algorithms that were implemented are: Perceptron, Adaline, and currently working on K-NN. 

## Usage of Models

A simple usage example for Perceptron is:
```python
from perceptron import Perceptron

my_model = Perceptron()
my_model.train(X_train, Y_train)
my_model.predict(X_test)
```
A simple usage example for Adaline is:
```python
from perceptron import Perceptron

my_model = Perceptron()
my_model.train(X_train, Y_train)
my_model.predict(X_test)
```

## Usage of Visualisation
